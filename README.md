# MomsMillions
Private online database; Silent Anonymous Auction; authorized users granted virtual $1M to privately bid for late parent's stuff.

I place the idea for this program in the public domain.  Feel free to fork it as you please.

Gentle readers / coders - At my mother's request (and a little guidance from her), I started coding this project in the late 1980's in HyperPAD, an MSDOS clone of Apple's HyperCard.  Because of what she had seen in her extended family, she wanted a way, which would produce fewer bad feelings, for her survivors to decide who gets what of "Moms Millions".  After some discussion, she and I decided that they would each get a virtual $1,000,000.00 to bid, Silently and Anonymously, on her stuff; her stuff would be readable/viewable in either an online database or in a database file emailed as an attachment.  At some appropriate point after her death, an administrator would make activate the database, or mail it, and survivors would receive their notice and authorization code to access the database and to enter their bids.  After a resonable time had passed for accessing and bidding, the Auction would be closed/frozen and the winning bidders (after they submitted their bids [by email attachment?]) would be notified that they were now responsible for "getting" their item(s) from wherever it / they existed.

As of today, 24 August 2024, I have not uploaded any of my code; it is written in HyperPAD's PADtalk, a language _very_ similar to Pascal.  If things go as well as I hope in the next few weeks, I should be able to upload the latest version of the .PAD file in the repo; the code is in plain English text.

If you would like to take over (and re-write it in whatever language) or contribute to this project, please let me know.  Maybe a person or team would end up moving the project forward much better than I have; I am just a 72-year-old self-taught Turbo Pascal, HyperPAD, DOS Batch file, and MS Access moderate-level programmer.

I am sure my mother would have wanted to help others reduce or eliminate any bad feelings in their families and would be happy if the program was made available for free, or for a modest price (as much as a tank of gas? [$45? in 2024]) to cover basic costs of managing it, updating it, and making it available, to whoever wanted to use it.

Thank you for your time and interest,
Dave Manderscheid, Seattle Washington.
